 code to create object of Request class (you will have create class request it should act wrapper to
 structure created  from REQUEST whose address in pointer named as request and methods through
 which information from request structure can be extreacted
 It should also act as wrapper to dataCount and data
 And it should should have methods to extract data by name
 get("nm"),if nm does not exist then  return empty String
 
 code to create an object of Response class named as rs(You will have to create class wrap the necesssary parts
 in response object so that the writer method of the response class should be capable of
 sending response to client
 The close method of the response class should end the connection)
 
 Change the following line
 this->ptrOnRequest(request->dataCount,request->data);
 it should now be
 this->ptrOnRequest(rq,rs);
